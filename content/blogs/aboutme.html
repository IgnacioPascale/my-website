<p>Hi! I am a data advocate whose life calling is to help people take better, smarter and more efficient decisions based on evidence.</p>
<p>I have a BSc in Management and Information Systems from the Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires and I am currently reading for the MSc in Analytics and Management at London Business School.</p>
<p>Some of the skills I’ve developed since I started my journey are Python, R, SQL, Google Script and in-depth knowledge of cloud-based services such as Amazon S3, EC2 and Redshift, Google BigQuery and visualisation tools/libraries such as PowerBI and ggplot2/matplotlib libraries.</p>
<p>Alongside my formal education, I am currently self-learning C to learn how to write efficient code in different languages and Java to get to the roots of object-directed programming.</p>
