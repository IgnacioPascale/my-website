<h1>Learn about me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Ignacio Pascale. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>

</div>
<p>I always held strong family ties with my family. In 1910, my great-grand parents arrived in Argentina from the South of Italy, in persuit of a better life. Italian families can be quite particular: <em>family is the most important value.</em></p>
<p>Ever since childhood, my parents have taught me the values of helping people. Although this has always been an interest of mine, I didn’t exactly know to proceed and take those ideas into my life.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, after graduating high school, I decided to enroll in BSc in Business Administration and Information Systems at the Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (<em>Technological Institute of Buenos Aires</em>), one of the most prestigious universities in Argentina.</p>
<p>During my studies, I have always found myself in the intersection of Business and Science. However, it wasn’t until I entered the job market that I became increasingly interested in analytics.</p>
<p>In 2018, I started an internship at SAP in Argentina. Throughout, I advised companies in Chile to operate more smoothly by enabling innovation and driving digital transformation. Although I was interested in the commercial ramifications, I was not particularly enthralled by the role per se.</p>
<p>As my bachelors’ degree consisted of a mixture between management and technology, I reasoned that I could find another way of building bridges between the world of science and business.</p>
<p>Just months after, I decided to face the challenge and I began working as Data Analyst at Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>During this internship, I developed skills in Python and SQL and an in-depth knowledge of cloud-based services and data visualization tools. The projects I worked on and the research I conducted made me understand that analytics was not just a casual interest but my personal ambition.</p>
<p><strong>I realized, however, that my life calling was to use the power of data to help people take better decisions based on evidence.</strong></p>

<h1>From Argentina to the world</h1>
<p>In 2018, after returning home from an exchange programme in Louvain-la-neuve, Belgium, I took the decision to leave Argentina after my graduation and explore a new life in London. That plan worked a treat; in January 2020 I landed my first full-time job ever as a Junior Data Analyst in a tech company in South London.</p>

<p>I was involved in several projects such as the transformation and loading of multiples datasets received from different partners into the database, quality check analysis on the format of the data, in-depth analysis on the evolution of the partners’ sales and improvement of several processes by automating monotonous tasks, reducing the amount of time spent on standardized processes and leaving more room for high-value activities. The role required knowledge of database management and data wrangling, using Python, SQL and Alteryx.</p>
<p>During this period, my dream of becoming a Data Scientist just got bigger. For that reason, I decided to apply to the MSc in Analytics and Management at London Business School. After a long application process, I received my acceptance in May, 2020. The programme started on September 2020 and so far it has been the most enriching adventure of my life both socially and acamedically.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>Other than statistics, coding has become a passion of mine ever since my experience at Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>Some of the skills I’ve developed since I started my journey are Python, R, SQL, Google Script and in-depth knowledge of cloud-based services such as Amazon S3, EC2 and Redshift, Google BigQuery and visualisation tools/libraries such as PowerBI and ggplot2/matplotlib libraries.</p>
<p>Alongside my formal education, I am currently self-learning C to learn how to write efficient code in different languages and Java to get to the roots of object-directed programming.</p>

<div id="what-the-future-has-in-store-for-me" class="section level1">
<h1>What the future has in store for me</h1>
<p>After my graduation on July 2021, I plan to work as a Data Scientist with a broad business spectrum in the deep tech industry. Landing that job will be the wrap up of a story full of challenges, blood and sweat, but I will definitely go for more!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading until the end.</p>
